		<p>Hey, I'm Brandon. I'm a Software Developer at Solace Systems. I'm also a graduate from the Computer Systems Engineering program at Carleton University. I <b>LOVE</b> programming. On my free time, I like to tinker with projects and use the knowledge I've acquired from school and work to allow myself to be creative. I also enjoy badminton, rock climbing, and music.</p>
