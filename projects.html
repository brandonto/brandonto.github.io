		<p>A system for motion controlling InMoov, the open source 3d printed robot. Hand motion data is queried from a Leap Motion controller, processed, streamed over TCP/IP to an ARM Cortex M microcontroller which maps the data into PWM waves that moves the servo motors. Pressure sensors will provide closed loop feedback to the microcontroller when the hand comes into contact with an object.</p>
